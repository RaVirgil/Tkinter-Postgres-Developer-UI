# Tkinter-Postgres-Developer-UI
An app made in python with tkinter for doing stuff on a postgres db. Things like run custom SQL commands, view tables, insert tables, delete tables, update tables. I will also try to make tests for the database for constraints and triggers.

To change the db change the config from guihelper.py
